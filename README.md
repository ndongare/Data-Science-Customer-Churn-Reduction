# Data-Science-Customer-Churn-Reduction

A survey on customer satisfaction by Southeast airlines has determined that there is a high attrition by the customers who use their airline and the partner airlines. The company is reassessing their loyalty program model and its ability to retain customers. The company is trying to use the customer satisfaction survey to determine the parameters which might help improve the customer satisfaction and retain customers.

The survey contains 10,282 records across 32 different attributes trying to capture the customer’s information and satisfaction. It was determined that the customer attrition metric was a lagging indicator to determine the causes for a customer to switch airline preference. The Net promoter score (NPS) was indicated to be a good indicator to determine the customers overall satisfaction with the airlines. NPS asks a customer to rate on a scale of 1-10 (1 – Highly Unlikely; 10-Highly Likely) the likelihood to recommend the airlines to another person. The results of the NPS can help determine if the customer will be promoter, passive or detractor.

The project consists of analysis of the data to analyze factors such as age, gender, delays in arrival etc. affecting Net promoter Score. The analysis involves descriptive measures, visualizations and predictive models to build suggestions for Southeast airlines to improve customer satisfaction.
